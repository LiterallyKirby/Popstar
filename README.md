This is still in it's testing phase, some packages will proabally not work icl, not recomended as ur main install tool right now

I will personally not be adding default arch repository support my self because if you can't use pacman you might just be cooked

# To-Do

- Make the remove option functional
- Make menus look better
- I'll think of more as time goes on.

Features as of right now:

Installing packages

Auto Temp File clean

Decent looking tui

# Installation

You can either bulid it ur self using go or just use the install.sh script I wrote in 2 mins
